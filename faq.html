        I currently work as a manager for an association management company, completing a variety of different tasks and projects each day. The variation of my work has always driven me, I function best when I get to work on new and exciting things on a regular basis, and it helps me to stay fresh rather than complacent. Much of what I do is work with websites: I update information and event pages, troubleshoot basic HTML when something looks off, and I approve big website changes or overhauls. As much as I find the work I do to be exciting, I wasn’t as fulfilled as I knew I could be. I spent meetings wondering why I couldn’t be building the websites myself and devoted myself to determining “why” something worked the way it did online. It wasn’t until I realized how much these processes drove me that I began to ask, “why isn’t this what I’m doing in the first place”? Thus, my adventure began!

        When deciding where to focus my energy, I went back on forth on the merits between UX/UI design and web development. I worked on courses such as Free Code Camp to get a better idea of what the coding world looked like, and taught myself programs like Photoshop, InDesign, and Azure. While I’ll always have an eye on beautiful websites, my skills are best suited for coding. However, I’d like to work as a front-end developer, to help build what others can design. And who knows – maybe I’ll have the great typography suggestion that tweaks the website “just so”.

        I work with all sorts of clients! While I would love to one-day work on a political campaign, with an environmental organization, or with a major home magazine (like Domaine) – I’d love to work with anyone! I ask only that we maintain an open dialogue to ensure that your site looks exactly like you want it to, and that you are respectful of those around you and of me during our time together.

        My turnaround time will vary based on the size of the project that we undertake together. I will work with you to build an achievable timeline and stay on budget – it’s not in my interest or yours to waste time! Both of these skills were ones that I learned in the non-profit world, so I know how to use time efficiently.
